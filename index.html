             <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
             <div class="half-width">
               <p>I have made my home base in suburbs of Chicago, Illinois with my family. My journey into tech started with computer programming in college. As I learned Cobol, Pascal, JCL and Assembler, I was fascinated with how easily I could move from the big picture into the details of the program. As mainframe applications became less frequently used, I moved into network support, information security, and finally electronic health record.</p>
             </div>
             <div class="half-width">
               <p>But nothing was as exciting as building a program. I began to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I have made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

               <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>
